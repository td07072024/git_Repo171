The nominate subspecies of the Cuban trogon is found throughout the main island of Cuba and on several large cays off the Camag√ºey Province shore. P. t. vescus is found only on Isla de la Juventud (Isle of Pines). The species inhabits both primary and secondary forest and also shrublands and smaller woodlands near watercourses. It favors humid shady areas within those landscapes and occurs at all elevations but is most common at higher ones.
