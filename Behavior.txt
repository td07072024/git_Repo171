Movement
The Cuban trogan is mostly sedentary but makes seasonal local movements in elevation or in response to the availability of food. Their flight style is rather choppy and noisy.[3][5]

Social behavior
The Cuban trogon is usually found in pairs though sometimes in groups of three or four. They seem "indifferent to human presence in the immediate vicinity."[3]

Feeding
The Cuban trogon usually forages at the middle level of the forest; it takes food by sallying from a perch or by hovering at foliage or fruit. Its diet is mostly insects, fruit, and buds but it also feeds small lizards to young.
