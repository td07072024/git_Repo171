The Cuban trogon shares its genus with the Hispaniolan trogon (P. roseigaster). It has two subspecies, the nominate P. t. temnurus and P. t. vescus.[2]

In English the bird is commonly known as the Cuban trogon, while in Spanish, it is referred to as the tocororo. This local name is onomatopoeic, and was derived from its repeated call, "toco-toco-tocoro-tocoro".[3] It is the national bird of Cuba.
